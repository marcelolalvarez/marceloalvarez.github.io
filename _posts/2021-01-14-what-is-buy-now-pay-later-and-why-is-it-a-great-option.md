When you create an online store, it’s very important to provide your customers with as many payment options as possible. Buy Now Pay Later is a unique payment approach that, as the name says, allows customers to purchase a product in installments. That means they initiate the purchase, pay for one installment and receive the product. Not everyone is able to purchase some products, so having this type of financing without interest or a low amount of interest is a very good idea.

## You get to convert more visitors

Paying in multiple installments will bring in more conversions. If a person feels that the price is too high, that leads to cart abandonments. However, Buy Now Pay Later makes it easier for everyone to afford even the more expensive products.

## Buyers will end up acquisitioning more products

## Customers appreciate the idea of having multiple choices

This is not always available, so being able to have multiple choices is exhilarating and it brings in front great benefits. Some customers will just buy a product because it has the Buy Now Pay Later option, others just want a single payment and that’s it.
